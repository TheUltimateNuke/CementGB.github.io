### Building from source
#### Requirements
- A machine that can run Bash (Windows compatibility pending)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/)
- .NET 8 SDK and Runtime (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

#### Step-by-Step

1. **Clone this repository** to an empty folder using `git clone` or your preferred method.
2. **Make your changes.** Some guided examples and rules are listed below. Make sure to commit and/or push.
3. **Run the build script in `scripts/`.** It should handle the installing of DocFX and the building and packing of both the homepage and the docs automatically for then deploying elsewhere in raw HTML.

### Adding guides
Simply open `pages/docs/md` and add a Markdown file with the title of the page as the filename but in lowercase and with no spaces (i.e. `Getting Started` becomes `getting-started.md`). You can then make your changes. When you're done, simply commit, push and build using the steps from above.
