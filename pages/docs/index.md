# Cement Documentation

Welcome to the Cement docs. Here you will find detailed guides and references for the MelonLoader-based Gang Beasts modding library and information on mods made by the Cement Team.  
You can download the library [here](../).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you are an end user of Cement, you do not need to do anything with it except install it.** To you, Cement alone should change the gameplay very little. It is simply a utility for developers to get their mods done faster and better.

## Installation

1. Install the latest release of [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest/) from the installer or the zipped file located on their GitHub Releases page. (If you already have it, make sure it's up to date) Further instructions can be found on [their wiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/).
2. Run the game after installing MelonLoader to make sure it generates all the necessary files.
3. Download `CementGB.dll` from our GitHub Releases page, linked on the [landing page](../) in the `Download` button.
4. Drag `CementGB.dll` from your `Downloads` folder into the newly created `Mods` folder in your game folder, typically located at `C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Gang Beasts` if you own the game on Steam and are installing on Windows.
5. All done! Run the game and check for any issues. Report bugs to the Cement Discord first, and if we can't help you, the MelonLoader Discord probably could.
